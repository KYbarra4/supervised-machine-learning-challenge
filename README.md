## Retrieve the Data

The data is located in the Challenge Files Folder:

* `lending_data.csv`

Import the data using Pandas. Display the resulting dataframe to confirm the import was successful.

## Predict Model Performance

You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! 

Write down your prediction in the designated cells in your Jupyter Notebook, and provide justification for your educated guess.

*I predict that the Random Forests Classifier will perform better*

## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

## Create, Fit and Compare Models

Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a Random Forest Classifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. 

Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts in the designated markdown cell.

## Logistic Regression model

## Random Forest Classifier model

*My prediction of the Random Forrest Classifier Model was incorrect with the Logistic Regression Model having a Testing Data Score of 0.9924680148576145 and the Random Forrest Classifier Model having a Testing Score of 0.9917973586463062. This indicates the the Logistic Regression Model is more accurate.*
